# Business AI Action Hub · v2

The hub every owner leaves the 2-day Business AI workshop with. It is free on day one, and the same hub grows with the owner through six plans: from a live website and an AI Writer, to a weekly rhythm, the Action Program's frameworks filled in with their own numbers, sales and cash on a system, 6 AI staff on their own WhatsApp and Employz.ai, and finally a 30-strong AI workforce.

## The six plans

| Plan | Price | AI runs/month | In one line |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free | ₹0 | 10 | Website at `name.employz.ai`, Business Brain from a website / voice note / typed lines, Business AI Score, launch kit, AI Writer |
| Membership | ₹1,999/month (autopay) | 150 | The weekly rhythm (Monday plan, daily 5-minute action and streak, Friday score), festival calendar, member call, cohort board, AI tools, Magic Number, Gaps scan |
| Action Program | ₹10,000 once (1 year) | 300 | Lead magnet at `/guide`, offer ladder on the site, revenue levers and the 10×10×10 pledge, customer portfolio (A/B/C/D), Football Field pipeline, leak finder, 4 end goals, Send list with follow-ups and reviews |
| Running the Business | ₹25,000 once (1 year) | 400 | Employz.ai CRM starter (sync), customers A/B/C, GST quotations and invoices, money owed, payment reminders, quote follow-ups, customer desk |
| Growth Mentorship | ₹1,50,000 once (6 months) | 3,000 | 6 AI staff on the owner's own WhatsApp (AiSensy) and Employz.ai, done-for-you setup, Company Brain, money campaigns, Control Room, Sales Training Gym, AI results, team of 10 |
| LegacyWorkforce | ₹6,00,000 once (1 year) | 6,000 | 30 AI staff (6 in each of 5 departments, from 82 roles), the AI office, staff that act on their own, Tally/email/calendar, team of 25 |

Each plan includes everything below it. **Every feature is managed from Admin → Features & plans**: move it to another plan (drag and drop), switch it off for everyone, rename it, change its description and menu order, choose whether locked pages show as a teaser, edit each plan's price and limits, give one owner a feature without changing their plan, and undo any change from the log. Defaults live in `backend/app/plans.py`; the admin's changes are stored in the database and apply within seconds. `docs/PHASES.md` lists every feature by plan, and `docs/Action Hub v2 - Feature List by Plan.pdf` is the same list for sharing.

**Three rules hold everywhere:**

1. The hub's central WhatsApp number only ever messages **owners** (login codes, new-inquiry alerts, the digest and owner alerts).
2. Customer messages below ₹1.5L are **tap-to-send** from the owner's own WhatsApp (the hub prepares them in the Send list). From Growth Mentorship they can go from the owner's **own connected number** (AiSensy). Money messages (reminders, quotations) always wait for a person; only LegacyWorkforce staff may act on their own, and never with money or links.
3. Below ₹1.5L owners get **AI tools**; **AI staff** start at Growth Mentorship.

## Run it on your laptop

You need Python 3.11+, Node 20+, and MongoDB (`docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo:7`, or a free Atlas cluster).

```bash
# backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
export APP_ENV=development APP_URL=http://localhost:8000 MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 AI_PROVIDER=mock ADMIN_PHONES=+919999900000
python3 seed_demo.py                 # optional: demo data (logins below)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# frontend (second terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                          # http://localhost:5173 — proxies /api and /s/ to :8000
```

Demo logins after `seed_demo.py` (the login code is shown on screen in development):

| Number | Who |
|---|---|
| 9820000001 | Shree Ganesh Interiors — LegacyWorkforce (30 AI staff, AI office, team, every module) |
| 9820000011 / 9820000012 | Priya Nair (manager) / Suresh Yadav (staff) on that team |
| 9820000006 | Sharma Modular Kitchens — Growth Mentorship (WhatsApp chats, Telecaller call, campaign, Company Brain, setup) |
| 9820000005 | Patel Sweets & Farsan — Running the Business (customers, GST quotations, invoice, Send list) |
| 9820000003 | Arora Traders — Action Program |
| 9820000002 | Kapoor Dental Clinic — Membership (week, calendar, score, gaps, member call question) |
| 9820000004 | Mehta Engineering Works — Free |
| 9999900000 | Admin (Pulse, Features & plans, member calls, payments, domains, recordings) |

In development, with no WhatsApp or SMS keys set, the login code is shown on the login screen — only when `APP_ENV=development` **and** `APP_URL` is localhost. Demo WhatsApp and voice connections (provider `demo`) write to the `outbox` collection instead of sending. `AI_PROVIDER=mock` returns fixed demo text, so everything can be clicked through without an AI key.

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && pytest -q        # needs MongoDB at MONGO_URL; creates and wipes a throwaway database
```

217 tests, including the v2 suites:

- **Admin:** moving, switching off, renaming and undoing features; core features protected; plan prices (Membership needs a new Razorpay plan id); grants.
- **Free:** reading a website (redirects, sub-pages, contact details, 8 checks) and refusing private, odd or non-http addresses; voice/typed onboarding; the Business Score and share card; websites at `name.employz.ai`; visiting card; English polisher by plan.
- **Membership and Action Program:** the week, streak and weekly score; festival calendar; member call questions; cohort board; tools by plan; Magic Number; Gaps scan; lead magnet bringing leads; offer ladder on the site; levers; portfolio letters; leak finder; Football Field stages; goal kinds.
- **Running the Business:** A/B/C sorting; Excel/CSV import with merging; GST maths (CGST/SGST/IGST), invoices into Money owed; quote follow-ups on day 2/5/10 that never go out alone; customer desk; Employz.ai sync and webhook against a fake server.
- **Growth and LegacyWorkforce:** encrypted connections; AiSensy, Meta and ElevenLabs request shapes; WhatsApp AI replies, hand-over, the 24-hour window, daily caps, Meta signatures; Telecaller in calling hours and the signed post-call webhook; Company Brain; money campaigns in hours with a daily cap; Control Room, Gym, results; 6-per-department workforce.

## Deploy (Railway + MongoDB Atlas)

Everything — the wildcard domain for `name.employz.ai`, the hub's WhatsApp templates, each Growth owner's AiSensy, Employz.ai and ElevenLabs connections, Razorpay — is in **docs/Action Hub v2 - Developer Guide.pdf**. In short:

1. MongoDB Atlas M10 and Railway, both in Singapore; deploy this repo (the `Dockerfile` is picked up).
2. Variables from `backend/.env.example`: at minimum `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_URL`, `MONGO_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CONNECTIONS_KEY`, `ADMIN_PHONES`, an AI key, a login channel (AiSensy and/or MSG91), and `SITES_DOMAIN=employz.ai` with the wildcard record `*.employz.ai` added to Railway.
3. Payments: Razorpay keys, the ₹1,999 monthly plan id and the webhook.
4. Check `GET /api/health`, log in with an admin number, review **Admin → Features & plans**, and create the workshop cohort.

The app refuses to start in production with a weak `JWT_SECRET` or a non-https `APP_URL`.

## Notes for the developer

- **Database:** MongoDB. Attempt limits, run counting and exactly-once jobs rely on unique ids and single-document atomic updates.
- **Scheduler:** automations run from a loop inside each web worker (`RUN_SCHEDULER=true`); every job is claimed first, so several workers never send twice. Money campaigns tick in the same loop.
- **Owners' accounts:** API keys and tokens are encrypted with `CONNECTIONS_KEY` and never sent back to the browser. Each connection has its own secret webhook address. Set `CONNECTIONS_KEY` once and keep it — without it, keys are derived from `JWT_SECRET`.
- **Reading websites:** the address an owner types is untrusted. Only http(s) on ports 80/443, every host is resolved and refused if private, and the connection is pinned to the checked address; 2 MB and 4 redirects at most.
- **Payments:** Razorpay is the source of truth; refunds remove access and void commissions.
- **Disabling:** removing a number from `ADMIN_PHONES` revokes admin access at once; pausing an owner logs them out and takes their website offline; switching a feature off in Admin hides it for everyone within seconds.
