"""
Messages an automation (or an AI staff member) wants to send to a customer wait here — the Send list.

How a message leaves:
- "own":  the owner taps Send on WhatsApp — their own WhatsApp opens with the message typed (every plan; nothing to set up).
- "send": sent from the owner's own connected WhatsApp number (Growth Mentorship and up, once the number is connected):
          as a free-form message when the customer wrote in the last 24 hours, otherwise as the matching approved template.
- on its own: only LegacyWorkforce, only when the owner lets that department act, never for money messages
              (reminders, quotations, invoices) and never for text containing a link.
The hub's own WhatsApp number never messages customers; it only alerts the owner.
