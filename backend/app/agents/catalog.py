unlocks it) plus a runner. Built-in runners are attached in `runners.py`; other modules add their own with `register`.

A runner is `async def runner(owner: dict, run: dict) -> str | tuple[str, str | None]`, where
run = {"at": datetime (UTC), "slot": str | None, "job": dict | None, "spec": Spec}. It returns a one-line note
for the activity log (optionally with a reference id), or raises `Skip("why")` when there was nothing to do.
