"""
The plan ladder and every feature the hub has, in one registry.

Defaults live in code. The admin can change any feature (which plan it is in, on/off for everyone, its name and
description, its place in the menu, whether a locked one shows as a teaser) and any plan (name, price, AI runs, team
size, how long it lasts) from Admin → Plans & features. Those changes are stored in the `config` collection and applied
here in place, so every `plans.has(...)`, `plans.PLANS[...]` and `plans.FEATURES[...]` sees them at once.

A plan can come from four places — the admin, a referral trial, the Membership subscription, or a one-time purchase —
and the highest one that is still valid wins. The admin can also give one owner a single feature until a date (a grant).
