"""
Where each member website lives.

With SITES_DOMAIN set (e.g. employz.ai), every website is <name>.employz.ai: one wildcard DNS record and one wildcard
certificate cover every owner, so nobody touches DNS. Without it (a laptop, tests), websites live at APP_URL/s/<name>.
An owner's own domain (Growth Mentorship and up) is answered the same way once the admin marks it live.

Requests that arrive on a website's host are rewritten to the hub's /s/<name>/... routes, so only that website's pages
are reachable there: the hub's API and pages never answer on a member website's address.
